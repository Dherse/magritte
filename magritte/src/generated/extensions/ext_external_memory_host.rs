///# C Specifications
///To import memory from a host pointer, add a
///[`ImportMemoryHostPointerInfoEXT`] structure to the [`p_next`] chain of
///the [`MemoryAllocateInfo`] structure.
///The [`ImportMemoryHostPointerInfoEXT`] structure is defined as:
///```c
///// Provided by VK_EXT_external_memory_host
///typedef struct VkImportMemoryHostPointerInfoEXT {
///    VkStructureType                       sType;

///    VkExternalMemoryHandleTypeFlagBits    handleType;
///    void*                                 pHostPointer;
///} VkImportMemoryHostPointerInfoEXT;
///```
///# Members
/// - [`s_type`] is the type of this structure.
/// - [`p_next`] is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this structure.
/// - [`handle_type`] is a [`ExternalMemoryHandleTypeFlagBits`] value specifying the handle type.
/// - [`p_host_pointer`] is the host pointer to import from.
///# Description
///Importing memory from a host pointer shares ownership of the memory between
///the host and the Vulkan implementation.
///The application **can** continue to access the memory through the host pointer
///but it is the applicationâ€™s responsibility to synchronize device and
///non-device access to the payload as defined in
///[Host Access to Device Memory Objects](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#memory-device-hostaccess).Applications **can** import the same payload into multiple instances of Vulkan
///and multiple times into a given Vulkan instance.
///However, implementations **may** fail to import the same payload multiple times
///into a given physical device due to platform constraints.Importing memory from a particular host
/// pointer **may** not be possible due to
///additional platform-specific restrictions beyond the scope of this
///specification in which case the implementation **must** fail the memory import
///operation with the error code `VK_ERROR_INVALID_EXTERNAL_HANDLE_KHR`.Whether device memory
/// objects imported from a host pointer hold a reference
///to their payload is undefined.
///As such, the application **must** ensure that the imported memory range remains
///valid and accessible for the lifetime of the imported memory object.Valid Usage
/// - If [`handle_type`] is not `0`, it **must** be supported for import, as reported in
///   [`ExternalMemoryProperties`]
/// - If [`handle_type`] is not `0`, it **must** be
///   `VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_TYPE_HOST_ALLOCATION_BIT_EXT` or
///   `VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_TYPE_HOST_MAPPED_FOREIGN_MEMORY_BIT_EXT`
/// - [`p_host_pointer`]**must** be a pointer aligned to an integer multiple of
///   [`PhysicalDeviceExternalMemoryHostPropertiesEXT::min_imported_host_pointer_alignment`]
/// - If [`handle_type`] is `VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_TYPE_HOST_ALLOCATION_BIT_EXT`,
///   [`p_host_pointer`]**must** be a pointer to `allocationSize` number of bytes of host memory,
///   where `allocationSize` is the member of the [`MemoryAllocateInfo`] structure this structure is
///   chained to
/// - If [`handle_type`] is `VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_TYPE_HOST_MAPPED_FOREIGN_MEMORY_BIT_EXT`,
///   [`p_host_pointer`]**must** be a pointer to `allocationSize` number of bytes of host mapped
///   foreign memory, where `allocationSize` is the member of the [`MemoryAllocateInfo`] structure
///   this structure is chained to
///Valid Usage (Implicit)
/// - [`s_type`]**must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_IMPORT_MEMORY_HOST_POINTER_INFO_EXT`
