//![VK_KHR_deferred_host_operations](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_deferred_host_operations.html) - device extension
//!# Description
//!The `[`VK_KHR_deferred_host_operations`]` extension defines the
//!infrastructure and usage patterns for deferrable commands, but does not
//!specify any commands as deferrable.
//!This is left to additional dependent extensions.
//!Commands  **must**  not be deferred unless the deferral is specifically allowed
//!by another extension which depends on
//!`[`VK_KHR_deferred_host_operations`]`.
//!# Revision
//!4
//!# Dependencies
//! - Requires Vulkan 1.0
//!# Contacts
//! - Josh Barczak [jbarczak](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Docs/issues/new?body=[VK_KHR_deferred_host_operations]
//!   @jbarczak%0A<<Here describe the issue or question you have about the
//!   VK_KHR_deferred_host_operations extension>>)
//!# New handles
//! - [`DeferredOperationKHR`]
//!# New functions & commands
//! - [`create_deferred_operation_khr`]
//! - [`deferred_operation_join_khr`]
//! - [`destroy_deferred_operation_khr`]
//! - [`get_deferred_operation_max_concurrency_khr`]
//! - [`get_deferred_operation_result_khr`]
//!# New constants
//! - [`KHR_DEFERRED_HOST_OPERATIONS_EXTENSION_NAME`]
//! - [`KHR_DEFERRED_HOST_OPERATIONS_SPEC_VERSION`]
//! - Extending [`ObjectType`]:  - `VK_OBJECT_TYPE_DEFERRED_OPERATION_KHR`
//! - Extending [`VulkanResultCodes`]:  - `VK_OPERATION_DEFERRED_KHR`  -
//!   `VK_OPERATION_NOT_DEFERRED_KHR`  - `VK_THREAD_DONE_KHR`  - `VK_THREAD_IDLE_KHR`
//!# Known issues & F.A.Q
//!0. Should this extension have a VkPhysicalDevice*FeaturesKHR structure?
//! **RESOLVED** : No.
//!This extension does not add any functionality on its own and requires a
//!dependent extension to actually enable functionality and thus there is no
//!value in adding a feature structure.
//!If necessary, any dependent extension could add a feature boolean if it
//!wanted to indicate that it is adding optional deferral support.
//!# Version History
//! - Revision 1, 2019-12-05 (Josh Barczak, Daniel Koch)  - Initial draft.
//! - Revision 2, 2020-03-06 (Daniel Koch, Tobias Hector)  - Add missing
//!   VK_OBJECT_TYPE_DEFERRED_OPERATION_KHR enum  - fix sample code  - Clarified deferred operation
//!   parameter lifetimes (#2018,!3647)
//! - Revision 3, 2020-05-15 (Josh Barczak)  - Clarify behavior of
//!   vkGetDeferredOperationMaxConcurrencyKHR, allowing it to return 0 if the operation is complete
//!   (#2036,!3850)
//! - Revision 4, 2020-11-12 (Tobias Hector, Daniel Koch)  - Remove VkDeferredOperationInfoKHR and
//!   change return value semantics when deferred host operations are in use (#2067,3813)  - clarify
//!   return value of vkGetDeferredOperationResultKHR (#2339,!4110)

///```
/// # Parameters
/// - [`device`] is the device which owns [`operation`].
/// - [`operation`] is the deferred operation that the calling thread should work on.
/// # Description
/// The [`deferred_operation_join_khr`] command will execute a portion of the
/// deferred operation on the calling thread.The return value will be one of the following:
/// - A return value of `VK_SUCCESS` indicates that [`operation`] is complete. The application
///   **should**  use [`get_deferred_operation_result_khr`] to retrieve the result of [`operation`].
/// - A return value of `VK_THREAD_DONE_KHR` indicates that the deferred operation is not complete,
///   but there is no work remaining to assign to threads. Future calls to
///   [`deferred_operation_join_khr`] are not necessary and will simply harm performance. This
///   situation  **may**  occur when other threads executing [`deferred_operation_join_khr`] are
///   about to complete [`operation`], and the implementation is unable to partition the workload
///   any further.
/// - A return value of `VK_THREAD_IDLE_KHR` indicates that the deferred operation is not complete,
///   and there is no work for the thread to do at the time of the call. This situation  **may**
///   occur if the operation encounters a temporary reduction in parallelism. By returning
///   `VK_THREAD_IDLE_KHR`, the implementation is signaling that it expects that more opportunities
///   for parallelism will emerge as execution progresses, and that future calls to
///   [`deferred_operation_join_khr`] **can**  be beneficial. In the meantime, the application
///   **can**  perform other work on the calling thread.
/// Implementations  **must**  guarantee forward progress by enforcing the following
/// invariants:
/// 0. If only one thread has invoked [`deferred_operation_join_khr`] on a given operation, that
/// thread  **must**  execute the operation to completion and return `VK_SUCCESS`.
/// 1. If multiple threads have concurrently invoked [`deferred_operation_join_khr`] on the same
/// operation, then at least one of them  **must**  complete the operation and return `VK_SUCCESS`.
///
/// ## Valid Usage (Implicit)
/// - [`device`] **must**  be a valid [`Device`] handle
/// - [`operation`] **must**  be a valid [`DeferredOperationKHR`] handle
/// - [`operation`] **must**  have been created, allocated, or retrieved from [`device`]
///
/// ## Return Codes
/// * - `VK_SUCCESS`  - `VK_THREAD_DONE_KHR`  - `VK_THREAD_IDLE_KHR`

    ///   [`deferred_operation_join_khr`] are not necessary and will simply harm performance. This

    ///   about to complete [`operation`], and the implementation is unable to partition the

    /// - A return value of `VK_THREAD_IDLE_KHR` indicates that the deferred operation is not
    ///   complete, and there is no work for the thread to do at the time of the call. This
    ///   situation  **may**  occur if the operation encounters a temporary reduction in
    ///   parallelism. By returning `VK_THREAD_IDLE_KHR`, the implementation is signaling that it
    ///   expects that more opportunities for parallelism will emerge as execution progresses, and
    ///   that future calls to [`deferred_operation_join_khr`] **can**  be beneficial. In the
    ///   meantime, the application  **can**  perform other work on the calling thread.

    /// 0. If only one thread has invoked [`deferred_operation_join_khr`] on a given operation, that
    /// thread  **must**  execute the operation to completion and return `VK_SUCCESS`.
    /// 1. If multiple threads have concurrently invoked [`deferred_operation_join_khr`] on the same
    /// operation, then at least one of them  **must**  complete the operation and return
    /// `VK_SUCCESS`.
