///# Members
/// - [`s_type`] is the type of this structure.
/// - [`p_next`] is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this structure.
/// - [`flags`] is reserved for future use.
/// - [`coverage_modulation_mode`] is a [`CoverageModulationModeNV`] value controlling which color
///   components are modulated.
/// - [`coverage_modulation_table_enable`] controls whether the modulation factor is looked up from
///   a table in [`p_coverage_modulation_table`].
/// - [`coverage_modulation_table_count`] is the number of elements in
///   [`p_coverage_modulation_table`].
/// - [`p_coverage_modulation_table`] is a table of modulation factors containing a value for each
///   number of covered samples.
///# Description
///If [`coverage_modulation_table_enable`] is [`FALSE`], then for each
///color sample the associated bits of the pixel coverage are counted and
///divided by the number of associated bits to produce a modulation factor
///R in the range (0,1] (a value of zero would have been killed due
///to a color coverage of 0).
///Specifically:
/// - N = value of `rasterizationSamples`
/// - M = value of [`AttachmentDescription::samples`] for any color attachments
/// - R = popcount(associated coverage bits) / (N / M)
///If [`coverage_modulation_table_enable`] is [`TRUE`], the value R
///is computed using a programmable lookup table.
///The lookup table has N / M elements, and the element of the table is
///selected by:
/// - R = [`p_coverage_modulation_table`][popcount(associated coverage bits)-1]
///Note that the table does not have an entry for popcount(associated
///coverage bits) = 0, because such samples would have been killed.The values of
/// [`p_coverage_modulation_table`]**may** be rounded to an
///implementation-dependent precision, which is at least as fine as 1 /
///N, and clamped to [0,1].For each color attachment with a floating point or normalized color
/// format,
///each fragment output color value is replicated to M values which **can**
///each be modulated (multiplied) by that color sampleâ€™s associated value of
///R.
///Which components are modulated is controlled by
///[`coverage_modulation_mode`].If this structure is not included in the [`p_next`] chain, it is as
/// if
///[`coverage_modulation_mode`] is `VK_COVERAGE_MODULATION_MODE_NONE_NV`.If the [coverage reduction mode](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#fragops-coverage-reduction) is
///`VK_COVERAGE_REDUCTION_MODE_TRUNCATE_NV`, each color sample is
///associated with only a single coverage sample.
///In this case, it is as if [`coverage_modulation_mode`] is
///`VK_COVERAGE_MODULATION_MODE_NONE_NV`.Valid Usage
/// - If [`coverage_modulation_table_enable`] is [`TRUE`],
///   [`coverage_modulation_table_count`]**must** be equal to the number of rasterization samples
///   divided by the number of color samples in the subpass
///Valid Usage (Implicit)
/// - [`s_type`]**must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PIPELINE_COVERAGE_MODULATION_STATE_CREATE_INFO_NV`
/// - [`flags`]**must** be `0`
/// - [`coverage_modulation_mode`]**must** be a valid [`CoverageModulationModeNV`] value
