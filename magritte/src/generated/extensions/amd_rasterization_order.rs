//![VK_AMD_rasterization_order](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_AMD_rasterization_order.html) - device extension
//!# Description
//!This extension introduces the possibility for the application to control the
//!order of primitive rasterization.
//!In unextended Vulkan, the following stages are guaranteed to execute in *API
//!order*:
//! - depth bounds test
//! - stencil test, stencil op, and stencil write
//! - depth test and depth write
//! - occlusion queries
//! - blending, logic op, and color writeThis extension enables applications to opt into a relaxed,
//!   implementation
//!defined primitive rasterization order that may allow better parallel
//!processing of primitives and thus enabling higher primitive throughput.
//!It is applicable in cases where the primitive rasterization order is known
//!to not affect the output of the rendering or any differences caused by a
//!different rasterization order are not a concern from the point of view of
//!the applicationâ€™s purpose.A few examples of cases when using the relaxed primitive rasterization
//! order
//!would not have an effect on the final rendering:
//! - If the primitives rendered are known to not overlap in framebuffer
//!space.
//! - If depth testing is used with a comparison operator of
//!`VK_COMPARE_OP_LESS`, `VK_COMPARE_OP_LESS_OR_EQUAL`,
//!`VK_COMPARE_OP_GREATER`, or `VK_COMPARE_OP_GREATER_OR_EQUAL`,
//!and the primitives rendered are known to not overlap in clip space.
//! - If depth testing is not used and blending is enabled for all attachments
//!with a commutative blend operator.

//!# Known issues & F.A.Q
//!1) How is this extension useful to application developers?**RESOLVED**: Allows them to increase
//! primitive throughput for cases when
//!strict API order rasterization is not important due to the nature of the
//!content, the configuration used, or the requirements towards the output of
//!the rendering.2) How does this extension interact with content optimizations aiming to
//!reduce overdraw by appropriately ordering the input primitives?**RESOLVED**: While the relaxed
//! rasterization order might somewhat limit the
//!effectiveness of such content optimizations, most of the benefits of it are
//!expected to be retained even when the relaxed rasterization order is used,
//!so applications **should** still apply these optimizations even if they intend
//!to use the extension.3) Are there any guarantees about the primitive rasterization order when
//!using the new relaxed mode?**RESOLVED**: No.
//!In this case the rasterization order is completely implementation-dependent,
//!but in practice it is expected to partially still follow the order of
//!incoming primitives.4) Does the new relaxed rasterization order have any adverse effect on
//!repeatability and other invariance rules of the API?**RESOLVED**: Yes, in the sense that it
//! extends the list of exceptions when
//!the repeatability requirement does not apply.
