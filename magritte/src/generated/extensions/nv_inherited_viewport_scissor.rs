///# Description
///If the [`p_next`] chain of [`CommandBufferInheritanceInfo`] includes a

///structure controls whether a command buffer **can** inherit the following state
///from other command buffers:
/// - `VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_SCISSOR`

/// - `VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_DISCARD_RECTANGLE_EXT`
///as well as the following state, with restrictions on inherited depth values
///and viewport count:
/// - `VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_VIEWPORT`
/// - `VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_VIEWPORT_WITH_COUNT`
///If [`viewport_scissor_2_d`] is [`FALSE`], then the command buffer does
///not inherit the listed dynamic state, and **should** set this state itself.
///If this structure is not present, the behavior is as if
///[`viewport_scissor_2_d`] is [`FALSE`].If [`viewport_scissor_2_d`] is [`TRUE`], then the listed
/// dynamic state
///is inherited, and the command buffer **must** not set this
///state, except that the viewport and scissor count **may** be set by binding a
///graphics pipeline that does not specify this state as dynamic.When the command buffer is
/// executed as part of a the execution of a
///[`CmdExecuteCommands`] command, the inherited state (if enabled) is
///determined by the following procedure, performed separately for each dynamic
///state, and separately for each value for dynamic state that consists of
///multiple values (e.g. multiple viewports).
/// - With i being the index of the executed command buffer in the `pCommandBuffers` array of
///   [`CmdExecuteCommands`], if i > 0 and any secondary command buffer from index 0 to i-1 modifies
///   the state, the inherited state is provisionally set to the final value set by the last such
///   secondary command buffer. Binding a graphics pipeline defining the state statically is
///   equivalent to setting the state to an undefined value.
/// - Otherwise, the tentatative inherited state is that of the primary command buffer at the point
///   the [`CmdExecuteCommands`] command was recorded; if the state is undefined, then so is the
///   provisional inherited state.
/// - If the provisional inherited state is an undefined value, then the state is not inherited.
/// - If the provisional inherited state is a viewport, with n being its viewport index, then if n â‰¥
///   [`viewport_depth_count`], or if either [`Viewport::min_depth`] or [`Viewport::max_depth`] are
///   not equal to the respective values of the n<sup>th</sup> element of [`p_viewport_depths`],
///   then the state is not inherited.
/// - If the provisional inherited state passes both checks, then it becomes the actual inherited
///   state.
///Valid Usage
