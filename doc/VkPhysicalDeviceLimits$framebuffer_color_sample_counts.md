[`framebuffer_color_sample_counts`] is a bitmask<sup>1</sup> of
[`SampleCountFlagBits`] indicating the color sample counts that are
supported for all framebuffer color attachments with floating- or
fixed-point formats.
For color attachments with integer formats, see
[`framebufferIntegerColorSampleCounts`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#limits-framebufferIntegerColorSampleCounts).
