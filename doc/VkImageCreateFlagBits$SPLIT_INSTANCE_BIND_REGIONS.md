[`SPLIT_INSTANCE_BIND_REGIONS`] specifies that the
image  **can**  be used with a non-zero value of the
`splitInstanceBindRegionCount` member of a
[`BindImageMemoryDeviceGroupInfo`] structure passed into
[`bind_image_memory2`].
This flag also has the effect of making the image use the standard
sparse image block dimensions.
