[`ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR`] A surface has changed in such a way that
it is no longer compatible with the swapchain, and further presentation
requests using the swapchain will fail.
Applications  **must**  query the new surface properties and recreate their
swapchain if they wish to continue presenting to the surface.
