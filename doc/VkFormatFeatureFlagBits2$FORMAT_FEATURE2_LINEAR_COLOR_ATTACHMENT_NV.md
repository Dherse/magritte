[`FORMAT_FEATURE2_LINEAR_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_NV`] specifies that
   the format is supported as a renderable [Linear Color
   Attachment](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#glossary).
   This bit will be set for renderable color formats in the
   `linearTilingFeatures`.
This  **must**  not be set in the `optimalTilingFeatures` or
`bufferFeatures` members.
