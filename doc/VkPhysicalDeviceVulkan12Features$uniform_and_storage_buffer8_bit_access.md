[`uniform_and_storage_buffer8_bit_access`] indicates whether objects in the
`Uniform` storage class with the `Block` decoration  **can**  have
8-bit integer members.
If this feature is not enabled, 8-bit integer members  **must**  not be used
in such objects.
This also indicates whether shader modules  **can**  declare the
`UniformAndStorageBuffer8BitAccess` capability.
