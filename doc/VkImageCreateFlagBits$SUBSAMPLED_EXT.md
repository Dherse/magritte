[`SUBSAMPLED_EXT`] specifies that an image  **can**  be
in a subsampled format which  **may**  be more optimal when written as an
attachment by a render pass that has a fragment density map attachment.
Accessing a subsampled image has additional considerations:
 - Image data read as an image sampler will have undefined values if the sampler was not created with `flags` containing `VK_SAMPLER_CREATE_SUBSAMPLED_BIT_EXT` or was not sampled through the use of a combined image sampler with an immutable sampler in [`DescriptorSetLayoutBinding`].
 - Image data read with an input attachment will have undefined values if the contents were not written as an attachment in an earlier subpass of the same render pass.
 - Image data read as an image sampler in the fragment shader will be additionally be read by the device during `VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_VERTEX_SHADER_BIT` if [[`PhysicalDeviceFragmentDensityMap2PropertiesEXT`]::`subsampledCoarseReconstructionEarlyAccess`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#limits-subsampledCoarseReconstructionEarlyAccess) is `VK_TRUE` and the sampler was created with `flags` containing `VK_SAMPLER_CREATE_SUBSAMPLED_COARSE_RECONSTRUCTION_BIT_EXT`.
 - Image data read with load operations are resampled to the fragment density of the render pass if [[`PhysicalDeviceFragmentDensityMap2PropertiesEXT`]::`subsampledLoads`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#limits-subsampledLoads) is `VK_TRUE`. Otherwise, values of image data are undefined.
 - Image contents outside of the render area take on undefined values if the image is stored as a render pass attachment.
