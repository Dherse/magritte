[`sub_texel_precision_bits`] is the
number of bits of precision in the division along an axis of an image
used for minification and magnification filters.
2<sup>[`sub_texel_precision_bits`]</sup> is the actual number of divisions
along each axis of the image represented.
Sub-texel values calculated during image sampling will snap to these
locations when generating the filtered results.
