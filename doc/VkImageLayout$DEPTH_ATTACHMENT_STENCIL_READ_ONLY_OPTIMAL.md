[`DEPTH_ATTACHMENT_STENCIL_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL`]
specifies a layout for depth/stencil format images allowing read and
write access to the depth aspect as a depth attachment, and read only
access to the stencil aspect as a stencil attachment or in shaders as a
sampled image, combined image/sampler, or input attachment.
It is equivalent to [`DEPTH_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL`] and
[`STENCIL_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL`].
