[VkMemoryAllocateInfo](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VkMemoryAllocateInfo.html) - Structure containing parameters of a memory allocation

# C Specifications
The [`MemoryAllocateInfo`] structure is defined as:
```c
// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
typedef struct VkMemoryAllocateInfo {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    const void*        pNext;
    VkDeviceSize       allocationSize;
    uint32_t           memoryTypeIndex;
} VkMemoryAllocateInfo;
```

# Members
- [`s_type`] is the type of this structure.
- [`p_next`] is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this structure.
- [`allocation_size`] is the size of the allocation in bytes.
- [`memory_type_index`] is an index identifying a memory type from the `memoryTypes` array of the [`PhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties`] structure.

# Description
The internal data of an allocated device memory object  **must**  include a
reference to implementation-specific resources, referred to as the memory
objectâ€™s *payload*.
Applications  **can**  also import and export that internal data to and from
device memory objects to share data between Vulkan instances and other
compatible APIs.
A [`MemoryAllocateInfo`] structure defines a memory import operation if
its [`p_next`] chain includes one of the following structures:
- [`ImportMemoryWin32HandleInfoKHR`] with a non-zero `handleType` value
- [`ImportMemoryFdInfoKHR`] with a non-zero `handleType` value
- [`ImportMemoryHostPointerInfoEXT`] with a non-zero `handleType` value
- [`ImportAndroidHardwareBufferInfoANDROID`] with a non-`NULL``buffer` value
- [`ImportMemoryZirconHandleInfoFUCHSIA`] with a non-zero `handleType` value
- [`ImportMemoryBufferCollectionFUCHSIA`]
If the parameters define an import operation and the external handle type is
`VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_TYPE_D3D11_TEXTURE_BIT`,
`VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_TYPE_D3D11_TEXTURE_KMT_BIT`, or
`VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_TYPE_D3D12_RESOURCE_BIT`,
[`allocation_size`] is ignored.
The implementation  **must**  query the size of these allocations from the OS.Whether device memory objects constructed via a memory import operation hold
a reference to their payload depends on the properties of the handle type
used to perform the import, as defined below for each valid handle type.
Importing memory  **must**  not modify the content of the memory.
Implementations  **must**  ensure that importing memory does not enable the
importing Vulkan instance to access any memory or resources in other Vulkan
instances other than that corresponding to the memory object imported.
Implementations  **must**  also ensure accessing imported memory which has not
been initialized does not allow the importing Vulkan instance to obtain data
from the exporting Vulkan instance or vice-versa.Importing memory  **must**  not increase overall heap usage within a system.
However, it  **must**  affect the following per-process values:
- [`PhysicalDeviceMaintenance3Properties`]`::maxMemoryAllocationCount`
- [`PhysicalDeviceMemoryBudgetPropertiesEXT::heap_usage`]
When performing a memory import operation, it is the responsibility of the
application to ensure the external handles and their associated payloads
meet all valid usage requirements.
However, implementations  **must**  perform sufficient validation of external
handles and payloads to ensure that the operation results in a valid memory
object which will not cause program termination, device loss, queue stalls,
or corruption of other resources when used as allowed according to its
allocation parameters.
If the external handle provided does not meet these requirements, the
implementation  **must**  fail the memory import operation with the error code
`VK_ERROR_INVALID_EXTERNAL_HANDLE`.
