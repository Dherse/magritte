[`storage_push_constant8`] indicates whether objects in the
`PushConstant` storage class  **can**  have 8-bit integer members.
If this feature is not enabled, 8-bit integer members  **must**  not be used
in such objects.
This also indicates whether shader modules  **can**  declare the
`StoragePushConstant8` capability.
