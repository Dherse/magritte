[`PIPELINE_STAGE2_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT`] specifies the
stage of the pipeline after blending where the final color values are
output from the pipeline.
This stage also includes [subpass load and
store operations](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#renderpass-load-store-ops) and multisample resolve operations for framebuffer
attachments with a color
or depth/stencil
format.
