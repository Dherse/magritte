[`buffer_image_granularity`] is the
granularity, in bytes, at which buffer or linear image resources, and
optimal image resources  **can**  be bound to adjacent offsets in the same
[`DeviceMemory`] object without aliasing.
See [Buffer-Image Granularity](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#resources-bufferimagegranularity) for
more details.
