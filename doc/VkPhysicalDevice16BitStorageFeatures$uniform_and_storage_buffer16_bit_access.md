[`uniform_and_storage_buffer16_bit_access`] specifies whether objects in
the `Uniform` storage class with the `Block` decoration  **can**  have
16-bit integer and 16-bit floating-point members.
If this feature is not enabled, 16-bit integer or 16-bit floating-point
members  **must**  not be used in such objects.
This also specifies whether shader modules  **can**  declare the
`UniformAndStorageBuffer16BitAccess` capability.
