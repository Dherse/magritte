# Description
- [`TRANSFER_SRC`] specifies that the buffer  **can**  be used as the source of a *transfer command* (see the definition of [`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_TRANSFER_BIT`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#synchronization-pipeline-stages-transfer)).
- [`TRANSFER_DST`] specifies that the buffer  **can**  be used as the destination of a transfer command.
- [`UNIFORM_TEXEL_BUFFER`] specifies that the buffer  **can**  be used to create a [`BufferView`] suitable for occupying a [`DescriptorSet`] slot of type `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_UNIFORM_TEXEL_BUFFER`.
- [`STORAGE_TEXEL_BUFFER`] specifies that the buffer  **can**  be used to create a [`BufferView`] suitable for occupying a [`DescriptorSet`] slot of type `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_STORAGE_TEXEL_BUFFER`.
- [`UNIFORM_BUFFER`] specifies that the buffer  **can**  be used in a [`DescriptorBufferInfo`] suitable for occupying a [`DescriptorSet`] slot either of type `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_UNIFORM_BUFFER` or `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_UNIFORM_BUFFER_DYNAMIC`.
- [`STORAGE_BUFFER`] specifies that the buffer  **can**  be used in a [`DescriptorBufferInfo`] suitable for occupying a [`DescriptorSet`] slot either of type `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_STORAGE_BUFFER` or `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_STORAGE_BUFFER_DYNAMIC`.
- [`INDEX_BUFFER`] specifies that the buffer is suitable for passing as the `buffer` parameter to [`cmd_bind_index_buffer`].
- [`VERTEX_BUFFER`] specifies that the buffer is suitable for passing as an element of the `pBuffers` array to [`cmd_bind_vertex_buffers`].
- [`INDIRECT_BUFFER`] specifies that the buffer is suitable for passing as the `buffer` parameter to [`cmd_draw_indirect`], [`cmd_draw_indexed_indirect`], [`cmd_draw_mesh_tasks_indirect_nv`], [`cmd_draw_mesh_tasks_indirect_count_nv`], or [`cmd_dispatch_indirect`]. It is also suitable for passing as the `buffer` member of [`IndirectCommandsStreamNV`], or `sequencesCountBuffer` or `sequencesIndexBuffer` or `preprocessedBuffer` member of [`GeneratedCommandsInfoNV`]
- [`CONDITIONAL_RENDERING_EXT`] specifies that the buffer is suitable for passing as the `buffer` parameter to [`cmd_begin_conditional_rendering_ext`].
- [`TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BUFFER_EXT`] specifies that the buffer is suitable for using for binding as a transform feedback buffer with [`cmd_bind_transform_feedback_buffers_ext`].
- [`TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_COUNTER_BUFFER_EXT`] specifies that the buffer is suitable for using as a counter buffer with [`cmd_begin_transform_feedback_ext`] and [`cmd_end_transform_feedback_ext`].
- [`RAY_TRACING_NV`] specifies that the buffer is suitable for use in [`cmd_trace_rays_nv`].
- [`SHADER_BINDING_TABLE_KHR`] specifies that the buffer is suitable for use as a [Shader Binding Table](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#shader-binding-table).
- [`ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_BUILD_INPUT_READ_ONLY_KHR`] specifies that the buffer is suitable for use as a read-only input to an [acceleration structure build](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#acceleration-structure-building).
- [`ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_STORAGE_KHR`] specifies that the buffer is suitable for storage space for a [`AccelerationStructureKHR`].
- [`SHADER_DEVICE_ADDRESS`] specifies that the buffer  **can**  be used to retrieve a buffer device address via [`get_buffer_device_address`] and use that address to access the bufferâ€™s memory from a shader.
- [`VIDEO_DECODE_SRC_KHR`] specifies that the buffer  **can**  be used as the source bitstream buffer in a [video decode operation](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#video-decode-operations).
- [`VIDEO_DECODE_DST_KHR`] specifies that the buffer  **can**  be used as the destination status buffer in a [video decode operation](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#video-decode-operations).
- [`VIDEO_ENCODE_DST_KHR`] specifies that the buffer  **can**  be used as the destination bitstream buffer in a [video encode operation](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#video-encode-operations).
- [`VIDEO_ENCODE_DST_KHR`] specifies that the buffer  **can**  be used as the destination status buffer in a [video encode operation](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#video-encode-operations).
