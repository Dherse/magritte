[`large_points`] specifies whether points with
size greater than 1.0 are supported.
If this feature is not enabled, only a point size of 1.0 written by a
shader is supported.
The range and granularity of supported point sizes are indicated by the
`pointSizeRange` and `pointSizeGranularity` members of the
[`PhysicalDeviceLimits`] structure, respectively.
