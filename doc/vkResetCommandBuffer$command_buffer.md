[`command_buffer`] is the command buffer to reset.
The command buffer  **can**  be in any state other than
[pending](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#commandbuffers-lifecycle), and is moved into the
[initial state](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#commandbuffers-lifecycle).
