[`PROTECTED`] specifies that queues in this queue family
support the `VK_DEVICE_QUEUE_CREATE_PROTECTED_BIT` bit.
(see [Protected Memory](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#memory-protected-memory)).
If the physical device supports the `protectedMemory` feature, at
least one of its queue families  **must**  support this bit.
