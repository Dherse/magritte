[`DEPTH_READ_ONLY_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL`]
specifies a layout for depth/stencil format images allowing read and
write access to the stencil aspect as a stencil attachment, and read
only access to the depth aspect as a depth attachment or in shaders as a
sampled image, combined image/sampler, or input attachment.
It is equivalent to [`DEPTH_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL`] and
[`STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL`].
