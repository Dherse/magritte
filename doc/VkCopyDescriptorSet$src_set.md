[`src_set`], [`src_binding`], and [`src_array_element`] are the source
set, binding, and array element, respectively.
If the descriptor binding identified by [`src_set`] and
[`src_binding`] has a descriptor type of
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_INLINE_UNIFORM_BLOCK` then [`src_array_element`]
specifies the starting byte offset within the binding to copy from.
