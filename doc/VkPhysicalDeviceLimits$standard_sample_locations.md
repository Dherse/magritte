[`standard_sample_locations`]
specifies whether rasterization uses the standard sample locations as
documented in [Multisampling](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#primsrast-multisampling).
If set to [`TRUE`], the implementation uses the documented sample
locations.
If set to [`FALSE`], the implementation  **may**  use different sample
locations.
