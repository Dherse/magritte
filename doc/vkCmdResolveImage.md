# C Specifications
To resolve a multisample color image to a non-multisample color image, call:
```c
// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
void vkCmdResolveImage(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    VkImage                                     srcImage,
    VkImageLayout                               srcImageLayout,
    VkImage                                     dstImage,
    VkImageLayout                               dstImageLayout,
    uint32_t                                    regionCount,
    const VkImageResolve*                       pRegions);
```

# Parameters
- [`command_buffer`] is the command buffer into which the command will be recorded.
- [`src_image`] is the source image.
- [`src_image_layout`] is the layout of the source image subresources for the resolve.
- [`dst_image`] is the destination image.
- [`dst_image_layout`] is the layout of the destination image subresources for the resolve.
- [`region_count`] is the number of regions to resolve.
- [`p_regions`] is a pointer to an array of [`ImageResolve`] structures specifying the regions to resolve.

# Description
During the resolve the samples corresponding to each pixel location in the
source are converted to a single sample before being written to the
destination.
If the source formats are floating-point or normalized types, the sample
values for each pixel are resolved in an implementation-dependent manner.
If the source formats are integer types, a single sampleâ€™s value is selected
for each pixel.`srcOffset` and `dstOffset` select the initial `x`, `y`, and
`z` offsets in texels of the sub-regions of the source and destination
image data.
`extent` is the size in texels of the source image to resolve in
`width`, `height` and `depth`.
Each element of [`p_regions`] **must**  be a region that is contained within
its corresponding image.Resolves are done layer by layer starting with `baseArrayLayer` member
of `srcSubresource` for the source and `dstSubresource` for the
destination.
`layerCount` layers are resolved to the destination image.
