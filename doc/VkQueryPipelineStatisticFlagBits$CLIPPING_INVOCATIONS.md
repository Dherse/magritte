[`CLIPPING_INVOCATIONS`] specifies
that queries managed by the pool will count the number of primitives
processed by the [Primitive Clipping](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#vertexpostproc-clipping) stage of
the pipeline.
The counterâ€™s value is incremented each time a primitive reaches the
primitive clipping stage.
