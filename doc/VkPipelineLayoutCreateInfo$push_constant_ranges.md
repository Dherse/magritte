[`push_constant_ranges`] is a pointer to an array of
[`PushConstantRange`] structures defining a set of push constant
ranges for use in a single pipeline layout.
In addition to descriptor set layouts, a pipeline layout also describes
how many push constants  **can**  be accessed by each stage of the pipeline.
