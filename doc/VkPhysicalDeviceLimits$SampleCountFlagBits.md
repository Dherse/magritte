For all bitmasks of [`SampleCountFlagBits`], the sample count limits
defined above represent the minimum supported sample counts for each
image type.
Individual images  **may**  support additional sample counts, which are
queried using [`get_physical_device_image_format_properties`] as
described in [Supported Sample
Counts](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#features-supported-sample-counts).
