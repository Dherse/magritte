[`INPUT_ASSEMBLY_VERTICES`] specifies
that queries managed by the pool will count the number of vertices
processed by the [input assembly](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#drawing) stage.
Vertices corresponding to incomplete primitives  **may**  contribute to the
count.
