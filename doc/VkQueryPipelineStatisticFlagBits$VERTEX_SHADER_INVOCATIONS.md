[`VERTEX_SHADER_INVOCATIONS`]
specifies that queries managed by the pool will count the number of
vertex shader invocations.
This counterâ€™s value is incremented each time a vertex shader is
[invoked](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#shaders-vertex-execution).
