# Description
- [`VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_FLAG_BITS`] specifies that queries managed by the pool will count the number of vertices processed by the [input assembly](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#drawing) stage. Vertices corresponding to incomplete primitives  **may**  contribute to the count.
- [`VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_FLAG_BITS`] specifies that queries managed by the pool will count the number of primitives processed by the [input assembly](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#drawing) stage. If primitive restart is enabled, restarting the primitive topology has no effect on the count. Incomplete primitives  **may**  be counted.
- [`VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_FLAG_BITS`] specifies that queries managed by the pool will count the number of vertex shader invocations. This counter’s value is incremented each time a vertex shader is [invoked](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#shaders-vertex-execution).
- [`VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_FLAG_BITS`] specifies that queries managed by the pool will count the number of geometry shader invocations. This counter’s value is incremented each time a geometry shader is [invoked](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#shaders-geometry-execution). In the case of [instanced geometry shaders](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#geometry-invocations), the geometry shader invocations count is incremented for each separate instanced invocation.
- [`VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_FLAG_BITS`] specifies that queries managed by the pool will count the number of primitives generated by geometry shader invocations. The counter’s value is incremented each time the geometry shader emits a primitive. Restarting primitive topology using the SPIR-V instructions `OpEndPrimitive` or `OpEndStreamPrimitive` has no effect on the geometry shader output primitives count.
- [`VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_FLAG_BITS`] specifies that queries managed by the pool will count the number of primitives processed by the [Primitive Clipping](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#vertexpostproc-clipping) stage of the pipeline. The counter’s value is incremented each time a primitive reaches the primitive clipping stage.
- [`VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_FLAG_BITS`] specifies that queries managed by the pool will count the number of primitives output by the [Primitive Clipping](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#vertexpostproc-clipping) stage of the pipeline. The counter’s value is incremented each time a primitive passes the primitive clipping stage. The actual number of primitives output by the primitive clipping stage for a particular input primitive is implementation-dependent but  **must**  satisfy the following conditions:  - If at least one vertex of the input primitive lies inside the clipping volume, the counter is incremented by one or more.  - Otherwise, the counter is incremented by zero or more. 
- [`VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_FLAG_BITS`] specifies that queries managed by the pool will count the number of fragment shader invocations. The counter’s value is incremented each time the fragment shader is [invoked](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#fragops-shader).
- [`VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_FLAG_BITS`] specifies that queries managed by the pool will count the number of patches processed by the tessellation control shader. The counter’s value is incremented once for each patch for which a tessellation control shader is [invoked](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#shaders-tessellation-control-execution).
- [`VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_FLAG_BITS`] specifies that queries managed by the pool will count the number of invocations of the tessellation evaluation shader. The counter’s value is incremented each time the tessellation evaluation shader is [invoked](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#shaders-tessellation-evaluation-execution).
- [`VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_FLAG_BITS`] specifies that queries managed by the pool will count the number of compute shader invocations. The counter’s value is incremented every time the compute shader is invoked. Implementations  **may**  skip the execution of certain compute shader invocations or execute additional compute shader invocations for implementation-dependent reasons as long as the results of rendering otherwise remain unchanged.
These values are intended to measure relative statistics on one
implementation.
Various device architectures will count these values differently.
Any or all counters  **may**  be affected by the issues described in
[Query Operation](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#queries-operation-undefined).If a pipeline has `rasterizerDiscardEnable` enabled, implementations
 **may**  discard primitives after the final
[pre-rasterization shader
stage](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#pipeline-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization).
As a result, if `rasterizerDiscardEnable` is enabled, the clipping input
and output primitives counters  **may**  not be incremented.When a pipeline statistics query finishes, the result for that query is
marked as available.
The application  **can**  copy the result to a buffer (via
[`cmd_copy_query_pool_results`]), or request it be put into host memory (via
[`get_query_pool_results`]).
