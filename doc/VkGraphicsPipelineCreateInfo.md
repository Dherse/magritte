# Members

- [`p_next`] is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this structure.
- [`flags`] is a bitmask of [`PipelineCreateFlagBits`] specifying how the pipeline will be generated.

- [`vertex_input_state`] is a pointer to a [`PipelineVertexInputStateCreateInfo`] structure defining vertex input state for use with vertex shading.
- [`input_assembly_state`] is a pointer to a [`PipelineInputAssemblyStateCreateInfo`] structure which determines input assembly behavior for vertex shading, as described in [Drawing Commands](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#drawing).

# Description
The parameters [`base_pipeline_handle`] and [`base_pipeline_index`] are
described in more detail in [Pipeline
Derivatives](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#pipelines-pipeline-derivatives).If any shader stage fails to compile,
the compile log will be reported back to the application, and
`VK_ERROR_INVALID_SHADER_NV` will be generated.The state required for a graphics pipeline is divided into
[vertex input state](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#pipeline-graphics-subsets-vertex-input),
[pre-rasterization shader
state](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#pipeline-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization), [fragment shader
state](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#pipeline-graphics-subsets-fragment-shader), and [fragment output
state](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#pipeline-graphics-subsets-fragment-output).Vertex input state is defined by:
- [`PipelineVertexInputStateCreateInfo`]
- [`PipelineInputAssemblyStateCreateInfo`]
Pre-rasterization shader state is defined by:
- [`PipelineShaderStageCreateInfo`] entries for:  - Vertex shaders  - Tessellation control shaders  - Tessellation evaluation shaders  - Geometry shaders  - Task shaders  - Mesh shaders 
- Within the [`PipelineLayout`], all bindings that affect the specified shader stages
- [`PipelineViewportStateCreateInfo`]
- [`PipelineRasterizationStateCreateInfo`]
- [`PipelineTessellationStateCreateInfo`]
- [`RenderPass`] and [`subpass`] parameter
- [`PipelineDiscardRectangleStateCreateInfoEXT`]
- [`PipelineFragmentShadingRateStateCreateInfoKHR`]
- [`PipelineFragmentShadingRateEnumStateCreateInfoNV`]
Fragment shader state is defined by:
- A [`PipelineShaderStageCreateInfo`] entry for the fragment shader
- Within the [`PipelineLayout`], all bindings that affect the fragment shader
- [`PipelineMultisampleStateCreateInfo`]
- [`PipelineDepthStencilStateCreateInfo`]
- [`RenderPass`] and [`subpass`] parameter
- [`PipelineFragmentShadingRateStateCreateInfoKHR`]
- [`PipelineFragmentShadingRateEnumStateCreateInfoNV`]
Fragment output state is defined by:
- [`PipelineColorBlendStateCreateInfo`]
- The `alphaToCoverageEnable` and `alphaToOneEnable` members of [`PipelineMultisampleStateCreateInfo`].
- [`RenderPass`] and [`subpass`] parameter
A complete graphics pipeline always includes
[pre-rasterization shader
state](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#pipeline-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization), with other subsets included depending on that state.
If the [pre-rasterization
shader state](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#pipeline-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization) includes a vertex shader, then
[vertex input state](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#pipeline-graphics-subsets-vertex-input) is included
in a complete graphics pipeline.
If the value of
[`PipelineRasterizationStateCreateInfo::rasterizer_discard_enable`]
in the [pre-rasterization
shader state](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#pipeline-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization) is [`FALSE`]
or the `VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_RASTERIZER_DISCARD_ENABLE` dynamic state is
enabled
[fragment shader state](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#pipeline-graphics-subsets-fragment-shader) and
[fragment output interface
state](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#pipeline-graphics-subsets-fragment-output) is included in a complete graphics pipeline.Pipelines  **must**  be created with a complete set of pipeline state.
