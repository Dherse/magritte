[`storage_input_output16`] specifies whether objects in the `Input`
and `Output` storage classes  **can**  have 16-bit integer and 16-bit
floating-point members.
If this feature is not enabled, 16-bit integer or 16-bit floating-point
members  **must**  not be used in such objects.
This also specifies whether shader modules  **can**  declare the
`StorageInputOutput16` capability.
