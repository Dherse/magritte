[VkPhysicalDeviceMultiviewProperties](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VkPhysicalDeviceMultiviewProperties.html) - Structure describing multiview limits that can be supported by an implementation

# C Specifications
The [`PhysicalDeviceMultiviewProperties`] structure is defined as:
```c
// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_1
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceMultiviewProperties {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    uint32_t           maxMultiviewViewCount;
    uint32_t           maxMultiviewInstanceIndex;
} VkPhysicalDeviceMultiviewProperties;
```
or the equivalent
```c
// Provided by VK_KHR_multiview
typedef VkPhysicalDeviceMultiviewProperties VkPhysicalDeviceMultiviewPropertiesKHR;
```

# Members
- [`s_type`] is the type of this structure.
- [`p_next`] is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this structure.

# Description
- [`max_multiview_view_count`] is one greater than the maximum view index that  **can**  be used in a subpass.
- [`max_multiview_instance_index`] is the maximum valid value of instance index allowed to be generated by a drawing command recorded within a subpass of a multiview render pass instance.
If the [`PhysicalDeviceMultiviewProperties`] structure is included in the [`p_next`] chain of the
[`PhysicalDeviceProperties2`] structure passed to
[`get_physical_device_properties2`], it is filled in with each
corresponding implementation-dependent property.
## Valid Usage (Implicit)
-  [`s_type`] **must**  be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_MULTIVIEW_PROPERTIES`

- [`crate::vulkan1_1`]
