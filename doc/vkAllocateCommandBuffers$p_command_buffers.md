[`p_command_buffers`] is a pointer to an array of [`CommandBuffer`]
handles in which the resulting command buffer objects are returned.
The array  **must**  be at least the length specified by the
`commandBufferCount` member of [`p_allocate_info`].
Each allocated command buffer begins in the initial state.
