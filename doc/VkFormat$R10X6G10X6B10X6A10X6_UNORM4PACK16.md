four-component, 64-bit unsigned normalized format that has a 10-bit R
component in the top 10 bits of the word in bytes 0..1, a 10-bit G
component in the top 10 bits of the word in bytes 2..3, a 10-bit B
component in the top 10 bits of the word in bytes 4..5, and a 10-bit A
component in the top 10 bits of the word in bytes 6..7, with the bottom
6 bits of each word unused.
