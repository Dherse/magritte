[VkWriteDescriptorSet](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VkWriteDescriptorSet.html) - Structure specifying the parameters of a descriptor set write operation

# C Specifications
The [`WriteDescriptorSet`] structure is defined as:
```c
// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
typedef struct VkWriteDescriptorSet {
    VkStructureType                  sType;
    const void*                      pNext;
    VkDescriptorSet                  dstSet;
    uint32_t                         dstBinding;
    uint32_t                         dstArrayElement;
    uint32_t                         descriptorCount;

} VkWriteDescriptorSet;
```

# Members
- [`s_type`] is the type of this structure.
- [`p_next`] is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this structure.
- [`dst_set`] is the destination descriptor set to update.
- [`dst_binding`] is the descriptor binding within that set.
- [`dst_array_element`] is the starting element in that array. If the descriptor binding identified by [`dst_set`] and [`dst_binding`] has a descriptor type of `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_INLINE_UNIFORM_BLOCK` then [`dst_array_element`] specifies the starting byte offset within the binding.
- [`descriptor_count`] is the number of descriptors to update. If the descriptor binding identified by [`dst_set`] and [`dst_binding`] has a descriptor type of `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_INLINE_UNIFORM_BLOCK`, then [`descriptor_count`] specifies the number of bytes to update. Otherwise, [`descriptor_count`] is one of  - the number of elements in [`image_info`]  - the number of elements in [`buffer_info`]  - the number of elements in [`texel_buffer_view`]  - a value matching the `dataSize` member of a [`WriteDescriptorSetInlineUniformBlock`] structure in the [`p_next`] chain  - a value matching the `accelerationStructureCount` of a [`WriteDescriptorSetAccelerationStructureKHR`] structure in the [`p_next`] chain 
- [`descriptor_type`] is a [`DescriptorType`] specifying the type of each descriptor in [`image_info`], [`buffer_info`], or [`texel_buffer_view`], as described below. If [`DescriptorSetLayoutBinding`] for [`dst_set`] at [`dst_binding`] is not equal to `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_MUTABLE_VALVE`, [`descriptor_type`] **must**  be the same type as the [`descriptor_type`] specified in [`DescriptorSetLayoutBinding`] for [`dst_set`] at [`dst_binding`]. The type of the descriptor also controls which array the descriptors are taken from.
- [`image_info`] is a pointer to an array of [`DescriptorImageInfo`] structures or is ignored, as described below.
- [`buffer_info`] is a pointer to an array of [`DescriptorBufferInfo`] structures or is ignored, as described below.
- [`texel_buffer_view`] is a pointer to an array of [`BufferView`] handles as described in the [Buffer Views](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#resources-buffer-views) section or is ignored, as described below.

# Description
Only one of [`image_info`], [`buffer_info`], or [`texel_buffer_view`]
members is used according to the descriptor type specified in the
[`descriptor_type`] member of the containing [`WriteDescriptorSet`]
structure,
or none of them in case [`descriptor_type`] is
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_INLINE_UNIFORM_BLOCK`, in which case the source data
for the descriptor writes is taken from the
[`WriteDescriptorSetInlineUniformBlock`] structure included in the
[`p_next`] chain of [`WriteDescriptorSet`],
or if [`descriptor_type`] is
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_KHR`, in which case the
source data for the descriptor writes is taken from the
[`WriteDescriptorSetAccelerationStructureKHR`] structure in the
[`p_next`] chain of [`WriteDescriptorSet`],
or if [`descriptor_type`] is
`VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_NV`, in which case the source
data for the descriptor writes is taken from the
[`WriteDescriptorSetAccelerationStructureNV`] structure in the
[`p_next`] chain of [`WriteDescriptorSet`],
as specified below.If the [nullDescriptor](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#features-nullDescriptor) feature is enabled, the
buffer,
acceleration structure,
imageView, or bufferView  **can**  be [`crate::Handle::null`].
Loads from a null descriptor return zero values and stores and atomics to a
null descriptor are discarded.
A null acceleration structure descriptor results in the miss shader being
invoked.If the destination descriptor is a mutable descriptor, the active descriptor
type for the destination descriptor becomes [`descriptor_type`].If the [`dst_binding`] has fewer than [`descriptor_count`] array elements
remaining starting from [`dst_array_element`], then the remainder will be
used to update the subsequent binding - [`dst_binding`]+1 starting at
array element zero.
If a binding has a [`descriptor_count`] of zero, it is skipped.
This behavior applies recursively, with the update affecting consecutive
bindings as needed to update all [`descriptor_count`] descriptors.
Consecutive bindings  **must**  have identical [`DescriptorType`],
[VkShaderStageFlags](),
[`DescriptorBindingFlagBits`],
and immutable samplers references.
