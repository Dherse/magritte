[`SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL`] specifies a layout
allowing read-only access in a shader as a sampled image, combined
image/sampler, or input attachment.
This layout is valid only for image subresources of images created with
the `VK_IMAGE_USAGE_SAMPLED_BIT` or
`VK_IMAGE_USAGE_INPUT_ATTACHMENT_BIT` usage bits enabled.
