[vkCmdResetEvent2](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/vkCmdResetEvent2.html) - Reset an event object to non-signaled state

# C Specifications
To unsignal the event from a device, call:
```c
// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_3
void vkCmdResetEvent2(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    VkEvent                                     event,
    VkPipelineStageFlags2                       stageMask);
```
or the equivalent command
```c
// Provided by VK_KHR_synchronization2
void vkCmdResetEvent2KHR(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    VkEvent                                     event,
    VkPipelineStageFlags2                       stageMask);
```

# Parameters
- [`command_buffer`] is the command buffer into which the command is recorded.
- [`event`] is the event that will be unsignaled.
- [`stage_mask`] is a [`PipelineStageFlags2`] mask of pipeline stages used to determine the first [synchronization scope](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#synchronization-dependencies-scopes).

# Description
When [`cmd_reset_event2`] is submitted to a queue, it defines an execution
dependency on commands that were submitted before it, and defines an event
unsignal operation which resets the event to the unsignaled state.The first [synchronization scope](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#synchronization-dependencies-scopes)
includes all commands that occur earlier in
[submission order](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#synchronization-submission-order).
The synchronization scope is limited to operations by [`stage_mask`] or
stages that are [logically earlier](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#synchronization-pipeline-stages-order)
than [`stage_mask`].The second [synchronization scope](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#synchronization-dependencies-scopes)
includes only the event unsignal operation.If [`event`] is already in the unsignaled state when
[`cmd_reset_event2`] is executed on the device, then this command has no
effect, no event unsignal operation occurs, and no execution dependency is
generated.
