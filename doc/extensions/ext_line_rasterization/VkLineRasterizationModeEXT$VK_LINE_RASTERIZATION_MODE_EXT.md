[`VK_LINE_RASTERIZATION_MODE_EXT`] is equivalent to
[`VK_LINE_RASTERIZATION_MODE_EXT`] if
[`PhysicalDeviceLimits`]::`strictLines` is `VK_TRUE`,
otherwise lines are drawn as non-`strictLines` parallelograms.
Both of these modes are defined in [Basic Line
Segment Rasterization](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#primsrast-lines-basic).
