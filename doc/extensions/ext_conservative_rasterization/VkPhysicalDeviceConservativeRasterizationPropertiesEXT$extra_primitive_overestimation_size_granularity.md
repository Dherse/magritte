[`extra_primitive_overestimation_size_granularity`] is the granularity of
extra overestimation that can be specified in the pipeline state between
0.0 and [`max_extra_primitive_overestimation_size`] inclusive.
A value of 0.0 means the implementation can use the smallest
representable non-zero value in the screen space pixel fixed-point grid.
