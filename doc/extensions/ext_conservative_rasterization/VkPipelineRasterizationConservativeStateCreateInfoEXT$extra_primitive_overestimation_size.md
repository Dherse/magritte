[`extra_primitive_overestimation_size`] is the extra size in pixels to
increase the generating primitive during conservative rasterization at
each of its edges in `X` and `Y` equally in screen space beyond the base
overestimation specified in
[`PhysicalDeviceConservativeRasterizationPropertiesEXT`]::`primitiveOverestimationSize`.
