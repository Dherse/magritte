[VK_KHR_android_surface](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_android_surface.html) - instance extension

# Description
The [`VK_KHR_android_surface`] extension is an instance extension.
It provides a mechanism to create a [`SurfaceKHR`] object (defined by
the `[`VK_KHR_surface`]` extension) that refers to an
[`ANativeWindow`], Androidâ€™s native surface type.
The [`ANativeWindow`] represents the producer endpoint of any buffer
queue, regardless of consumer endpoint.
Common consumer endpoints for `ANativeWindows` are the system window
compositor, video encoders, and application-specific compositors importing
the images through a `SurfaceTexture`.

# Known issues & F.A.Q.
1) Does Android need a way to query for compatibility between a particular
physical device (and queue family?) and a specific Android display? **RESOLVED** : No.
Currently on Android, any physical device is expected to be able to present
to the system compositor, and all queue families must support the necessary
image layout transitions and synchronization operations.
