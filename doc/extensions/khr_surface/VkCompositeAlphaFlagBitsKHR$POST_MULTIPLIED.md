[`POST_MULTIPLIED`]: The alpha component,
if it exists, of the images is respected in the compositing process.
The non-alpha components of the image are not expected to already be
multiplied by the alpha component by the application; instead, the
compositor will multiply the non-alpha components of the image by the
alpha component during compositing.
