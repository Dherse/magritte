[VkPipelineCoverageModulationStateCreateInfoNV](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VkPipelineCoverageModulationStateCreateInfoNV.html) - Structure specifying parameters controlling coverage modulation

# C Specifications
As part of coverage reduction, fragment color values  **can**  also be modulated
(multiplied) by a value that is a function of fraction of covered
rasterization samples associated with that color sample.Pipeline state controlling coverage modulation is specified through the
members of the [`PipelineCoverageModulationStateCreateInfoNV`]
structure.The [`PipelineCoverageModulationStateCreateInfoNV`] structure is defined
as:
```c
// Provided by VK_NV_framebuffer_mixed_samples
typedef struct VkPipelineCoverageModulationStateCreateInfoNV {
    VkStructureType                                   sType;
    const void*                                       pNext;
    VkPipelineCoverageModulationStateCreateFlagsNV    flags;
    VkCoverageModulationModeNV                        coverageModulationMode;
    VkBool32                                          coverageModulationTableEnable;
    uint32_t                                          coverageModulationTableCount;
    const float*                                      pCoverageModulationTable;
} VkPipelineCoverageModulationStateCreateInfoNV;
```

# Members
- [`s_type`] is the type of this structure.
- [`p_next`] is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this structure.
- [`flags`] is reserved for future use.
- [`coverage_modulation_mode`] is a [`CoverageModulationModeNV`] value controlling which color components are modulated.
- [`coverage_modulation_table_enable`] controls whether the modulation factor is looked up from a table in [`coverage_modulation_table`].
- [`coverage_modulation_table_count`] is the number of elements in [`coverage_modulation_table`].
- [`coverage_modulation_table`] is a table of modulation factors containing a value for each number of covered samples.

# Description
If [`coverage_modulation_table_enable`] is `VK_FALSE`, then for each
color sample the associated bits of the pixel coverage are counted and
divided by the number of associated bits to produce a modulation factor
R in the range (0,1] (a value of zero would have been killed due
to a color coverage of 0).
Specifically:
- N = value of `rasterizationSamples`
- M = value of [`AttachmentDescription::samples`] for any color attachments
- R = popcount(associated coverage bits) / (N / M)
If [`coverage_modulation_table_enable`] is `VK_TRUE`, the value R
is computed using a programmable lookup table.
The lookup table has N / M elements, and the element of the table is
selected by:
- R = [`coverage_modulation_table`][popcount(associated coverage bits)-1]
Note that the table does not have an entry for popcount(associated
coverage bits) = 0, because such samples would have been killed.The values of [`coverage_modulation_table`] **may**  be rounded to an
implementation-dependent precision, which is at least as fine as 1 /
N, and clamped to [0,1].For each color attachment with a floating point or normalized color format,
each fragment output color value is replicated to M values which  **can** 
each be modulated (multiplied) by that color sampleâ€™s associated value of
R.
Which components are modulated is controlled by
[`coverage_modulation_mode`].If this structure is not included in the [`p_next`] chain, it is as if
[`coverage_modulation_mode`] is `VK_COVERAGE_MODULATION_MODE_NONE_NV`.If the [coverage reduction mode](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#fragops-coverage-reduction) is
`VK_COVERAGE_REDUCTION_MODE_TRUNCATE_NV`, each color sample is
associated with only a single coverage sample.
In this case, it is as if [`coverage_modulation_mode`] is
`VK_COVERAGE_MODULATION_MODE_NONE_NV`.
## Valid Usage
-    If [`coverage_modulation_table_enable`] is `VK_TRUE`, [`coverage_modulation_table_count`] **must**  be equal to the number of rasterization samples divided by the number of color samples in the subpass

## Valid Usage (Implicit)
-  [`s_type`] **must**  be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PIPELINE_COVERAGE_MODULATION_STATE_CREATE_INFO_NV`
-  [`flags`] **must**  be `0`
-  [`coverage_modulation_mode`] **must**  be a valid [`CoverageModulationModeNV`] value
