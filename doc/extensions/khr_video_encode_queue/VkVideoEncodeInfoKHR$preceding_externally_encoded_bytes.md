[`preceding_externally_encoded_bytes`] is the number of bytes externally
encoded for insertion in the active video encode session overall
bitstream prior to the bitstream that will be generated by the
implementation for this instance of [`VideoEncodeInfoKHR`].
Valid when [`VideoEncodeRateControlInfoKHR`]::`rateControlMode`
is not `VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_RATE_CONTROL_MODE_NONE_BIT_KHR`.
The value provided is used to update the implementationâ€™s rate control
algorithm for the rate control layer this instance of
[`VideoEncodeInfoKHR`] belongs to, by accounting for the bitrate
budget consumed by these externally encoded bytes.
See [`VideoEncodeRateControlInfoKHR`] for additional information
about encode rate control.
