[`dst_bitstream_buffer_max_range`] is the maximum size of the
[`dst_bitstream_buffer`] that can be used while the encoded bitstream
output is produced.
[`dst_bitstream_buffer_max_range`]â€™s value  **must**  be aligned to
[`VideoCapabilitiesKHR`]::`minBitstreamBufferSizeAlignment`, as
reported by the implementation.
