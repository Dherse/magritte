[VK_NV_cooperative_matrix](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_NV_cooperative_matrix.html) - device extension

# Description
This extension adds support for using cooperative matrix types in SPIR-V.
Cooperative matrix types are medium-sized matrices that are primarily
supported in compute shaders, where the storage for the matrix is spread
across all invocations in some scope (usually a subgroup) and those
invocations cooperate to efficiently perform matrix multiplies.Cooperative matrix types are defined by the
[`SPV_NV_cooperative_matrix`](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Registry/blob/master/extensions/NV/SPV_NV_cooperative_matrix.html)
SPIR-V extension and can be used with the
[`GL_NV_cooperative_matrix`](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/GLSL/blob/master/extensions/nv/GLSL_NV_cooperative_matrix.txt)
GLSL extension.This extension includes support for enumerating the matrix types and
dimensions that are supported by the implementation.

# Known issues & F.A.Q.
(1) What matrix properties will be supported in practice? **RESOLVED** : In NVIDIAâ€™s initial implementation, we will support:
- AType = BType = fp16 CType = DType = fp16 MxNxK = 16x8x16 scope = Subgroup
- AType = BType = fp16 CType = DType = fp16 MxNxK = 16x8x8 scope = Subgroup
- AType = BType = fp16 CType = DType = fp32 MxNxK = 16x8x16 scope = Subgroup
- AType = BType = fp16 CType = DType = fp32 MxNxK = 16x8x8 scope = Subgroup
