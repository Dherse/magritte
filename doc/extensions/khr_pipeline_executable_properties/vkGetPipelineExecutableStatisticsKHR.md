[vkGetPipelineExecutableStatisticsKHR](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/vkGetPipelineExecutableStatisticsKHR.html) - Get compile time statistics associated with a pipeline executable

# C Specifications
Each pipeline executable  **may**  have a set of statistics associated with it
that are generated by the pipeline compilation process.
These statistics  **may**  include things such as instruction counts, amount of
spilling (if any), maximum number of simultaneous threads, or anything else
which  **may**  aid developers in evaluating the expected performance of a
shader.
To query the compile-time statistics associated with a pipeline executable,
call:
```c
// Provided by VK_KHR_pipeline_executable_properties
VkResult vkGetPipelineExecutableStatisticsKHR(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    const VkPipelineExecutableInfoKHR*          pExecutableInfo,
    uint32_t*                                   pStatisticCount,
    VkPipelineExecutableStatisticKHR*           pStatistics);
```

# Parameters
- [`device`] is the device that created the pipeline.
- [`p_executable_info`] describes the pipeline executable being queried.
- [`p_statistic_count`] is a pointer to an integer related to the number of statistics available or queried, as described below.
- [`p_statistics`] is either `NULL` or a pointer to an array of [`PipelineExecutableStatisticKHR`] structures.

# Description
If [`p_statistics`] is `NULL`, then the number of statistics associated
with the pipeline executable is returned in [`p_statistic_count`].
Otherwise, [`p_statistic_count`] **must**  point to a variable set by the user
to the number of elements in the [`p_statistics`] array, and on return the
variable is overwritten with the number of structures actually written to
[`p_statistics`].
If [`p_statistic_count`] is less than the number of statistics associated
with the pipeline executable, at most [`p_statistic_count`] structures will
be written, and `VK_INCOMPLETE` will be returned instead of
`VK_SUCCESS`, to indicate that not all the available statistics were
returned.
## Valid Usage
-  [`pipelineExecutableInfo`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#features-pipelineExecutableInfo) **must**  be enabled
-  `pipeline` member of [`p_executable_info`] **must**  have been created with [`device`]
-  `pipeline` member of [`p_executable_info`] **must**  have been created with `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_CAPTURE_STATISTICS_BIT_KHR`

## Valid Usage (Implicit)
-  [`device`] **must**  be a valid [`Device`] handle
-  [`p_executable_info`] **must**  be a valid pointer to a valid [`PipelineExecutableInfoKHR`] structure
-  [`p_statistic_count`] **must**  be a valid pointer to a `uint32_t` value
-    If the value referenced by [`p_statistic_count`] is not `0`, and [`p_statistics`] is not `NULL`, [`p_statistics`] **must**  be a valid pointer to an array of [`p_statistic_count`][`PipelineExecutableStatisticKHR`] structures

## Return Codes
*   - `VK_SUCCESS`  - `VK_INCOMPLETE` 
*   - `VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY`  - `VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DEVICE_MEMORY`
