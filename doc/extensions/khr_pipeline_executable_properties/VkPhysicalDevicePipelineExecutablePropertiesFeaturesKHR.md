[VkPhysicalDevicePipelineExecutablePropertiesFeaturesKHR](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VkPhysicalDevicePipelineExecutablePropertiesFeaturesKHR.html) - Structure describing whether pipeline executable properties are available

# C Specifications
The [`PhysicalDevicePipelineExecutablePropertiesFeaturesKHR`] structure
is defined as:
```c
// Provided by VK_KHR_pipeline_executable_properties
typedef struct VkPhysicalDevicePipelineExecutablePropertiesFeaturesKHR {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           pipelineExecutableInfo;
} VkPhysicalDevicePipelineExecutablePropertiesFeaturesKHR;
```

# Members
This structure describes the following feature:

# Description
- [`s_type`] is the type of this structure.
- [`p_next`] is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this structure.
- [`pipeline_executable_info`] indicates that the implementation supports reporting properties and statistics about the pipeline executables associated with a compiled pipeline.
If the [`PhysicalDevicePipelineExecutablePropertiesFeaturesKHR`] structure is included in the [`p_next`] chain of the
[`PhysicalDeviceFeatures2`] structure passed to
[`get_physical_device_features2`], it is filled in to indicate whether each
corresponding feature is supported.
[`PhysicalDevicePipelineExecutablePropertiesFeaturesKHR`] **can**  also be used in the [`p_next`] chain of
[`DeviceCreateInfo`] to selectively enable these features.
## Valid Usage (Implicit)
-  [`s_type`] **must**  be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_PIPELINE_EXECUTABLE_PROPERTIES_FEATURES_KHR`
