[`clipped`] specifies whether the Vulkan implementation is allowed to
discard rendering operations that affect regions of the surface that are
not visible.
 - If set to `VK_TRUE`, the presentable images associated with the swapchain  **may**  not own all of their pixels. Pixels in the presentable images that correspond to regions of the target surface obscured by another window on the desktop, or subject to some other clipping mechanism will have undefined content when read back. Fragment shaders  **may**  not execute for these pixels, and thus any side effects they would have had will not occur. Setting `VK_TRUE` does not guarantee any clipping will occur, but allows more efficient presentation methods to be used on some platforms.
 - If set to `VK_FALSE`, presentable images associated with the swapchain will own all of the pixels they contain.
