[`min_image_extent`] contains the smallest valid swapchain extent for
the surface on the specified device.
The `width` and `height` of the extent will each be less than or
equal to the corresponding `width` and `height` of
[`current_extent`], unless [`current_extent`] has the special value
described above.
