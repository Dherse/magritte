[VK_EXT_depth_clip_control](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_depth_clip_control.html) - device extension

# Description
This extension allows the application to use the OpenGL depth range in NDC,
i.e. with depth in range [-1, 1], as opposed to Vulkanâ€™s default of
[0, 1].
The purpose of this extension is to allow efficient layering of OpenGL over
Vulkan, by avoiding emulation in the pre-rasterization shader stages.
This emulation, which effectively duplicates gl_Position but with a
different depth value, costs ALU and consumes shader output components that
the implementation may not have to spare to meet OpenGL minimum
requirements.

# Known issues & F.A.Q.
1) Should this extension include an origin control option to match
GL_LOWER_LEFT found in ARB_clip_control? **RESOLVED** : No.
The fix for porting over the origin is a simple y-axis flip.
The depth clip control is a much harder problem to solve than what this
extension is aimed to solve.
Adding an equivalent to GL_LOWER_LEFT would require more testing.2) Should this pipeline state be dynamic? **RESOLVED** : Yes.
The purpose of this extension is to emulate the OpenGL depth range, which is
expected to be globally fixed (in case of OpenGL ES) or very infrequently
changed (with `glClipControl` in OpenGL).3) Should the control provided in this extension be an enum that could be
extended in the future? **RESOLVED** : No.
It is highly unlikely that the depth range is changed to anything other than
[0, 1] in the future.
Should that happen a new extension will be required to extend such an enum,
and that extension might as well add a new struct to chain to
[`PipelineViewportStateCreateInfo::p_next`] instead.
