[`VK_FRAGMENT_SHADING_RATE_TYPE_NV`] specifies that a
graphics pipeline should obtain its pipeline fragment shading rate and
shading rate combiner state from the
[`PipelineFragmentShadingRateStateCreateInfoKHR`] structure and that
any state specified by the
[`PipelineFragmentShadingRateEnumStateCreateInfoNV`] structure
should be ignored.
