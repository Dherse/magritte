[`ENUMS`] specifies that a graphics
pipeline should obtain its pipeline fragment shading rate and shading
rate combiner state from the
[`PipelineFragmentShadingRateEnumStateCreateInfoNV`] structure and
that any state specified by the
[`PipelineFragmentShadingRateStateCreateInfoKHR`] structure should
be ignored.
