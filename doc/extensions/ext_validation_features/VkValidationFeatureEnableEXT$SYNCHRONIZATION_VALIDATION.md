[`SYNCHRONIZATION_VALIDATION`]
specifies that Vulkan synchronization validation is enabled.
This feature reports resource access conflicts due to missing or
incorrect synchronization operations between actions (Draw, Copy,
Dispatch, Blit) reading or writing the same regions of memory.
This feature is disabled by default.
