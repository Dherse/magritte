[VkPhysicalDeviceRGBA10X6FormatsFeaturesEXT](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VkPhysicalDeviceRGBA10X6FormatsFeaturesEXT.html) - Structure describing whether rendering to VK_FORMAT_R10X6G10X6B10X6A10X6_UNORM_4PACK16 formats can be supported by an implementation

# C Specifications
The [`PhysicalDeviceRgba10x6FormatsFeaturesEXT`] structure is defined
as:
```c
// Provided by VK_EXT_rgba10x6_formats
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceRGBA10X6FormatsFeaturesEXT {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           formatRgba10x6WithoutYCbCrSampler;
} VkPhysicalDeviceRGBA10X6FormatsFeaturesEXT;
```

# Members
The members of the [`PhysicalDeviceRgba10x6FormatsFeaturesEXT`]
structure describe the following features:

# Description
- [`s_type`] is the type of this structure.
- [`p_next`] is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this structure.
- [`format_rgba10x6_without_y_cb_cr_sampler`] indicates that `VK_FORMAT_R10X6G10X6B10X6A10X6_UNORM_4PACK16` **can**  be used with a [`ImageView`] with `subresourceRange.aspectMask` equal to `VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_COLOR_BIT` without a [sampler Yâ€²C<sub>B</sub>C<sub>R</sub> conversion](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#samplers-YCbCr-conversion) enabled.
If the [`PhysicalDeviceRgba10x6FormatsFeaturesEXT`] structure is included in the [`p_next`] chain of the
[`PhysicalDeviceFeatures2`] structure passed to
[`get_physical_device_features2`], it is filled in to indicate whether each
corresponding feature is supported.
[`PhysicalDeviceRgba10x6FormatsFeaturesEXT`] **can**  also be used in the [`p_next`] chain of
[`DeviceCreateInfo`] to selectively enable these features.
## Valid Usage (Implicit)
-  [`s_type`] **must**  be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_RGBA10X6_FORMATS_FEATURES_EXT`
