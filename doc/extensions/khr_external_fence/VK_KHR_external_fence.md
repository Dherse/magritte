[VK_KHR_external_fence](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_external_fence.html) - device extension

# Description
An application using external memory may wish to synchronize access to that
memory using fences.
This extension enables an application to create fences from which non-Vulkan
handles that reference the underlying synchronization primitive can be
exported.

# Registered extension number
114

# Revision
1

# Dependencies
- Requires Vulkan 1.0
- Requires `[`VK_KHR_external_fence_capabilities`]`

# Deprecation state
- *Promoted* to [Vulkan 1.1](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#versions-1.1-promotions)

# Known issues & F.A.Q.
This extension borrows concepts, semantics, and language from
`[`VK_KHR_external_semaphore`]`.
That extensionâ€™s issues apply equally to this extension.
