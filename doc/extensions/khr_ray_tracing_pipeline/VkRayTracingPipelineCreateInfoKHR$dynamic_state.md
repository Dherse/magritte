[`dynamic_state`] is a pointer to a
[`PipelineDynamicStateCreateInfo`] structure, and is used to
indicate which properties of the pipeline state object are dynamic and
 **can**  be changed independently of the pipeline state.
This  **can**  be `NULL`, which means no state in the pipeline is considered
dynamic.
