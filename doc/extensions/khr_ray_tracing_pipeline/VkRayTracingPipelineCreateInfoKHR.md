# Members
- [`s_type`] is the type of this structure.
- [`p_next`] is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this structure.
- [`flags`] is a bitmask of [`PipelineCreateFlagBits`] specifying how the pipeline will be generated.
- [`stage_count`] is the number of entries in the [`stages`] array.
- [`stages`] is a pointer to an array of [`stage_count`][`PipelineShaderStageCreateInfo`] structures describing the set of the shader stages to be included in the ray tracing pipeline.
- [`group_count`] is the number of entries in the [`groups`] array.
- [`groups`] is a pointer to an array of [`group_count`][`RayTracingShaderGroupCreateInfoKHR`] structures describing the set of the shader stages to be included in each shader group in the ray tracing pipeline.
- [`max_pipeline_ray_recursion_depth`] is the [maximum recursion depth](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#ray-tracing-recursion-depth) of shaders executed by this pipeline.
- [`library_info`] is a pointer to a [`PipelineLibraryCreateInfoKHR`] structure defining pipeline libraries to include.
- [`library_interface`] is a pointer to a [`RayTracingPipelineInterfaceCreateInfoKHR`] structure defining additional information when using pipeline libraries.
- [`dynamic_state`] is a pointer to a [`PipelineDynamicStateCreateInfo`] structure, and is used to indicate which properties of the pipeline state object are dynamic and  **can**  be changed independently of the pipeline state. This  **can**  be `NULL`, which means no state in the pipeline is considered dynamic.
- [`layout`] is the description of binding locations used by both the pipeline and descriptor sets used with the pipeline.
- [`base_pipeline_handle`] is a pipeline to derive from.
- [`base_pipeline_index`] is an index into the `pCreateInfos` parameter to use as a pipeline to derive from.

# Description
The parameters [`base_pipeline_handle`] and [`base_pipeline_index`] are
described in more detail in [Pipeline
Derivatives](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#pipelines-pipeline-derivatives).When `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_LIBRARY_BIT_KHR` is specified, this pipeline
defines a *pipeline library* which  **cannot**  be bound as a ray tracing
pipeline directly.
Instead, pipeline libraries define common shaders and shader groups which
 **can**  be included in future pipeline creation.If pipeline libraries are included in [`library_info`], shaders defined in
those libraries are treated as if they were defined as additional entries in
[`stages`], appended in the order they appear in the `pLibraries`
array and in the [`stages`] array when those libraries were defined.When referencing shader groups in order to obtain a shader group handle,
groups defined in those libraries are treated as if they were defined as
additional entries in [`groups`], appended in the order they appear in
the `pLibraries` array and in the [`groups`] array when those
libraries were defined.
The shaders these groups reference are set when the pipeline library is
created, referencing those specified in the pipeline library, not in the
pipeline that includes it.The default stack size for a pipeline if
`VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_RAY_TRACING_PIPELINE_STACK_SIZE_KHR` is not provided
is computed as described in [Ray Tracing
Pipeline Stack](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#ray-tracing-pipeline-stack).
