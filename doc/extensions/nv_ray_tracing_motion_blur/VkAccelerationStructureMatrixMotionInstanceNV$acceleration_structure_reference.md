[`acceleration_structure_reference`] is either:
 - a device address containing the value obtained from [`get_acceleration_structure_device_address_khr`] or [`get_acceleration_structure_handle_nv`]      (used by device operations which reference acceleration structures) or,
 - a [`AccelerationStructureKHR`] object (used by host operations which reference acceleration structures).
