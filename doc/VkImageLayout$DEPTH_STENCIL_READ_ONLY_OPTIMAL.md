[`DEPTH_STENCIL_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL`] specifies a layout
for both the depth and stencil aspects of a depth/stencil format image
allowing read only access as a depth/stencil attachment or in shaders as
a sampled image, combined image/sampler, or input attachment.
It is equivalent to [`DEPTH_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL`] and
[`STENCIL_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL`].
