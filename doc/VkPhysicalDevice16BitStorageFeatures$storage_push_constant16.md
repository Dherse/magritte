[`storage_push_constant16`] specifies whether objects in the
`PushConstant` storage class  **can**  have 16-bit integer and 16-bit
floating-point members.
If this feature is not enabled, 16-bit integer or floating-point members
 **must**  not be used in such objects.
This also specifies whether shader modules  **can**  declare the
`StoragePushConstant16` capability.
