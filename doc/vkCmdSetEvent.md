[vkCmdSetEvent](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/vkCmdSetEvent.html) - Set an event object to signaled state

# C Specifications
To set the state of an event to signaled from a device, call:
```c
// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
void vkCmdSetEvent(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    VkEvent                                     event,
    VkPipelineStageFlags                        stageMask);
```

# Parameters
- [`command_buffer`] is the command buffer into which the command is recorded.
- [`event`] is the event that will be signaled.
- [`stage_mask`] specifies the [source stage mask](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#synchronization-pipeline-stages) used to determine the first [synchronization scope](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#synchronization-dependencies-scopes).

# Description
[`cmd_set_event`] behaves identically to [`cmd_set_event2`], except that
it does not define an access scope, and  **must**  only be used with
[`cmd_wait_events`], not [`cmd_wait_events2`].
## Valid Usage
-    If the [geometry shaders](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html#features-geometryShader) feature is not enabled, [`stage_mask`] **must**  not contain `VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_GEOMETRY_SHADER_BIT`
-    If the [tessellation shaders](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html#features-tessellationShader) feature is not enabled, [`stage_mask`] **must**  not contain `VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_TESSELLATION_CONTROL_SHADER_BIT` or `VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_TESSELLATION_EVALUATION_SHADER_BIT`
-    If the [conditional rendering](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html#features-conditionalRendering) feature is not enabled, [`stage_mask`] **must**  not contain `VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_CONDITIONAL_RENDERING_BIT_EXT`
-    If the [fragment density map](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html#features-fragmentDensityMap) feature is not enabled, [`stage_mask`] **must**  not contain `VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_FRAGMENT_DENSITY_PROCESS_BIT_EXT`
-    If the [transform feedback](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html#features-transformFeedback) feature is not enabled, [`stage_mask`] **must**  not contain `VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BIT_EXT`
-    If the [mesh shaders](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html#features-meshShader) feature is not enabled, [`stage_mask`] **must**  not contain `VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_MESH_SHADER_BIT_NV`
-    If the [task shaders](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html#features-taskShader) feature is not enabled, [`stage_mask`] **must**  not contain `VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_TASK_SHADER_BIT_NV`
-    If the [shading rate image](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html#features-shadingRateImage) feature is not enabled, [`stage_mask`] **must**  not contain `VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_SHADING_RATE_IMAGE_BIT_NV`
-    If the [`synchronization2`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html#features-synchronization2) feature is not enabled, [`stage_mask`] **must**  not be `0`
-    Any pipeline stage included in [`stage_mask`] **must**  be supported by the capabilities of the queue family specified by the `queueFamilyIndex` member of the [`CommandPoolCreateInfo`] structure that was used to create the [`CommandPool`] that [`command_buffer`] was allocated from, as specified in the [table of supported pipeline stages](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#synchronization-pipeline-stages-supported)
-  [`stage_mask`] **must**  not include `VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_HOST_BIT`
-  [`command_buffer`]â€™s current device mask  **must**  include exactly one physical device

## Valid Usage (Implicit)
-  [`command_buffer`] **must**  be a valid [`CommandBuffer`] handle
-  [`event`] **must**  be a valid [`Event`] handle
-  [`stage_mask`] **must**  be a valid combination of [`PipelineStageFlagBits`] values
-  [`command_buffer`] **must**  be in the [recording state]()
-    The [`CommandPool`] that [`command_buffer`] was allocated from  **must**  support graphics, or compute operations
-    This command  **must**  only be called outside of a render pass instance
-    Both of [`command_buffer`], and [`event`] **must**  have been created, allocated, or retrieved from the same [`Device`]

## Host Synchronization
- Host access to [`command_buffer`] **must**  be externally synchronized
- Host access to the [`CommandPool`] that [`command_buffer`] was allocated from  **must**  be externally synchronized
