[`ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_READ_KHR`] specifies read
access to an acceleration structure as part of a trace, build, or copy
command, or to an [acceleration
structure scratch buffer](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#acceleration-structure-scratch) as part of a build command.
Such access occurs in the
`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_RAY_TRACING_SHADER_BIT_KHR` pipeline stage or
`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_BUILD_BIT_KHR` pipeline
stage.
