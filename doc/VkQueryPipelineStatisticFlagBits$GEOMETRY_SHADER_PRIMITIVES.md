[`GEOMETRY_SHADER_PRIMITIVES`]
specifies that queries managed by the pool will count the number of
primitives generated by geometry shader invocations.
The counterâ€™s value is incremented each time the geometry shader emits a
primitive.
Restarting primitive topology using the SPIR-V instructions
`OpEndPrimitive` or `OpEndStreamPrimitive` has no effect on the
geometry shader output primitives count.
