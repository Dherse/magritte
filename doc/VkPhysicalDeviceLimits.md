# Members
The [`PhysicalDeviceLimits`] are properties of the physical device.
These are available in the `limits` member of the
[`PhysicalDeviceProperties`] structure which is returned from
[`get_physical_device_properties`].

# Description
- [`max_image_dimension1_d`] is the largest dimension (`width`) that is guaranteed to be supported for all images created with an `imageType` of `VK_IMAGE_TYPE_1D`. Some combinations of image parameters (format, usage, etc.)  **may**  allow support for larger dimensions, which  **can**  be queried using [`get_physical_device_image_format_properties`].
- [`max_image_dimension2_d`] is the largest dimension (`width` or `height`) that is guaranteed to be supported for all images created with an `imageType` of `VK_IMAGE_TYPE_2D` and without `VK_IMAGE_CREATE_CUBE_COMPATIBLE_BIT` set in `flags`. Some combinations of image parameters (format, usage, etc.)  **may**  allow support for larger dimensions, which  **can**  be queried using [`get_physical_device_image_format_properties`].
- [`max_image_dimension3_d`] is the largest dimension (`width`, `height`, or `depth`) that is guaranteed to be supported for all images created with an `imageType` of `VK_IMAGE_TYPE_3D`. Some combinations of image parameters (format, usage, etc.)  **may**  allow support for larger dimensions, which  **can**  be queried using [`get_physical_device_image_format_properties`].
- [`max_image_dimension_cube`] is the largest dimension (`width` or `height`) that is guaranteed to be supported for all images created with an `imageType` of `VK_IMAGE_TYPE_2D` and with `VK_IMAGE_CREATE_CUBE_COMPATIBLE_BIT` set in `flags`. Some combinations of image parameters (format, usage, etc.)  **may**  allow support for larger dimensions, which  **can**  be queried using [`get_physical_device_image_format_properties`].
- [`max_image_array_layers`] is the maximum number of layers (`arrayLayers`) for an image.
- [`max_texel_buffer_elements`] is the maximum number of addressable texels for a buffer view created on a buffer which was created with the `VK_BUFFER_USAGE_UNIFORM_TEXEL_BUFFER_BIT` or `VK_BUFFER_USAGE_STORAGE_TEXEL_BUFFER_BIT` set in the `usage` member of the [`BufferCreateInfo`] structure.
- [`max_uniform_buffer_range`] is the maximum value that  **can**  be specified in the `range` member of a [`DescriptorBufferInfo`] structure passed to [`update_descriptor_sets`] for descriptors of type `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_UNIFORM_BUFFER` or `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_UNIFORM_BUFFER_DYNAMIC`.
- [`max_storage_buffer_range`] is the maximum value that  **can**  be specified in the `range` member of a [`DescriptorBufferInfo`] structure passed to [`update_descriptor_sets`] for descriptors of type `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_STORAGE_BUFFER` or `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_STORAGE_BUFFER_DYNAMIC`.
- [`max_push_constants_size`] is the maximum size, in bytes, of the pool of push constant memory. For each of the push constant ranges indicated by the `pPushConstantRanges` member of the [`PipelineLayoutCreateInfo`] structure, (`offset` +  `size`) **must**  be less than or equal to this limit.
- [`max_memory_allocation_count`] is the maximum number of device memory allocations, as created by [`allocate_memory`], which  **can**  simultaneously exist.
- [`max_sampler_allocation_count`] is the maximum number of sampler objects, as created by [`create_sampler`], which  **can**  simultaneously exist on a device.
- [`buffer_image_granularity`] is the granularity, in bytes, at which buffer or linear image resources, and optimal image resources  **can**  be bound to adjacent offsets in the same [`DeviceMemory`] object without aliasing. See [Buffer-Image Granularity](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#resources-bufferimagegranularity) for more details.
- [`sparse_address_space_size`] is the total amount of address space available, in bytes, for sparse memory resources. This is an upper bound on the sum of the sizes of all sparse resources, regardless of whether any memory is bound to them.
- [`max_bound_descriptor_sets`] is the maximum number of descriptor sets that  **can**  be simultaneously used by a pipeline. All [`DescriptorSet`] decorations in shader modules  **must**  have a value less than [`max_bound_descriptor_sets`].
