[`SPARSE_BINDING`] specifies that queues in this queue
family support sparse memory management operations (see
[Sparse Resources](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#sparsememory)).
If any of the sparse resource features are enabled, then at least one
queue family  **must**  support this bit.
